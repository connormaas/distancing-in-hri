# Replication of Human-Robot Proxemics: Physical and Psychological Distancing in Human-Robot Interaction

### Overview

This paper, which can be found in the root of this repository as `distancing-in-hri.pdf`, investigates the influence of robot likability, gaze, and participant personality on human-robot distancing behaviors. It is a replication of *Human-Robot Proxemics: Physical and Psychological Distancing in Human-Robot Interaction* by Jonathan Mumm and Bilge Mutlu, with a different robot and added conditions and metrics .

### Abstract

Designing robots with proxemics in mind ensures easy integration into daily life that is not disruptive to humans; this is a problem that the paper *Human-Robot Proxemics: Physical and Psychological Distancing in Human-Robot Interaction* by Jonathan Mumm and Bilge Mutlu works to address. This report details a replication of this paper, manipulating the likability and gaze of a robot to see how people distance themselves from robots. A unique addition to the original paper that our group added is an exploration of these questions by looking at participant personality. This report contributes to the previous studies on the topic and looks to confirm or deny results based on running a conceptual replication.

### Implementaiton

The robot selected for our study was `Misty` ([Misty?](https://www.mistyrobotics.com)). In order to set up effective automated experiments, `Misty` needed to be programmed using the visual programming language [Blocky](https://developers.google.com/blockly). The implementation for Misty, composed of audio, images, and saved Blocky congifurations is included in the `implementation` folder at the root of this repository.


### Contributions

I was one of four contributors to this paper, the three others being Flora Xia, Carly Pogue, and Alexis Sudjianto. I mainly focused on the **implementation** described above.
